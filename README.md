This project is an implementation of finite Red-Blue [Hackenbush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackenbush), mainly for mobile devices. Hackenbush is a simple and fun puzzle game that led to the discovery of a very large, fascinating algebraic structure, [the surreal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_number). It was invented by John Conway. 

The aim of this project is to promote combinatorial game theory by giving fans of Hackenbush an easy way to demonstrate it, and potentially to teach it to new players as well.

## How to Play
You can download an APK on the [releases page](https://github.com/file-acomplaint/hackenbush/releases), install via the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.file.hackenbush&pli=1) or build it yourself by opening the project in Godot 3.
While performance and stability is not guaranteed, [here](https://fi-le.itch.io/hackenbush) is a browser version, too! 

## Features
The project is in early development and current features are quite limited.

The [issues page](https://github.com/file-acomplaint/hackenbush/issues) lists some future feature ideas.

## Heritage
**Hackenbush: Pocket Edition** is made in [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) and steals the difficult part of its logic from a [great Hackenbush implementation](http://www.geometer.org/hackenbush/index.html) for Mac and PC, by Tom R. Davis. The pixel font is by [Kawika Heftel](https://khef.co/), licensed under CC0. Thanks!

Since Tom Davis' version is under the GPL 2.0 license, so is this project.

### Further Reading
- [Hackenbush: A window to a new world of math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYj4NkeGPdM) is a video explaining the rules of the game while walking the viewer through the discovery of surreal numbers. A must watch!
- [Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_Ways_for_Your_Mathematical_Plays) is a great introduction to combinatorial game theory in book format.
