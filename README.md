> Then, when I discovered surreal numbers, I realized that playing games _is_ mathematics. --- John Conway

# Hackenbush: Pocket Edition
This project is an implementation fof finite Red-Blue [Hackenbush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackenbush), mainly for mobile devices. Hackenbush is a simple and fun puzzle game that led to the discovery of an extremely interesting algebraic structure by legendary mathematician John Conway. 

## Features
- Perfect Computer Opponent
- Local 2-Player Mode
- 16 Levels

## In the Future
See the [issues page](https://github.com/file-acomplaint/hackenbush/issues) for future feature ideas.

## Heritage
**Hackenbush: Pocket Edition** is made in [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) and uses logic from a [great Hackenbush implementation](http://www.geometer.org/hackenbush/index.html) for Mac and PC, by Tom R. Davis.

## Literature
[Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_Ways_for_Your_Mathematical_Plays) is a great introduction to combinatorial game theory!
